She will always  hold a special place in my heart for showing me the path I couldn't see on my own. She made me feel like I was worthy of more and then, she went one step further and walked me through the process until the very end. Ms. Portman saved me from my life I thought I had to suffer through. She showed me how strong and important I am and cured me of all my worries.
