This place has so many manual processes and the owners run this place like a sweatshop. Antiquated systems geared for billing not for the client. When the entire company has to pitch in to help payroll, this should be a sign. Change the processes. Manager has no management skills. You are never given expectations surrounding the position.

EDO is in way over her head and ownership allows her to have control of too many things. Nepotism with her cohort runs rampant, and the treatment of employees leads to massive turnover and an overall toxic work environment.  The \"Mean Girls\" are going to run this place into the ground, and ownership seems to turn a blind eye. The best this place has to offer leave, and anyone that knows what they are doing and seems to be threat, will not be listened to and will be let go for no reason. The two ladies that seem to be calling the shots and chasing away the talent, would be lucky to be area and regional managers at any \"real\" regional, national, or global staffing agency. The COO let's it happen and protects her, and rumors of the extent of the \"relationship\" with the EDO seems to be the reason, and ownership is kept in the dark, or just blind to what is really happening. Terrible training, low pay, and leadership by intimidation is what you get!
