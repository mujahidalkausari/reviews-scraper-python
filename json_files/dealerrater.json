I Purchased a 2020 Siliverado from Lisa and Ron early December. Been down with Covid for a few weeks and now just back to normal and getting a chance to respond about my purchase. I want to say Lisa and Ron were awesome to work with. As a General Motors employee for 42 years this was the first used vehicle purchase I made since 1978. Everything went perfect! I would highly recommend the Haus Auto Group! 5 Stars plus.
