I bought the truck 10 days ago because I need to drive cross country and 3 days from leaving, I have no vehicle. Right now I have been waiting almost an hour and a half for the general manager and my salesman to call me back.\r\nI am cancelling my sale and will shop somewhere else.", "source": ""}, {"name": "Research", "date": "Jan 22, 2021", "avatar": "https://static1.cargurus.com/gfx/cg/user-noPic_vector.svg", "rating": "4", "title": "", "description": "Responsive", "source": ""}, {"name": "Youngstown", "date": "Dec 14, 2020", "avatar": "https://static1.cargurus.com/gfx/cg/user-noPic_vector.svg", "rating": "5", "title": "", "description": "Dealer got in touch with me very soon after my inquiry.

I had told the rep that it is very important for my family to have two sets of keys for my new car. He said that the car was the managers car that she had traded in and would check for the second set. I spoke with him twice the day I was to pick up the car and sent 2 emails advising it\u2019s IMPERATIVE for me to have two sets of keys. Long story short.. the dealership didn\u2019t take my request into consideration. Had an extremely rude rep confront me and my boyfriend when we asked for a manager as soon as we walked in. Once the situation was resolved. The rude rep didn\u2019t show us to the car, on how things work, to go over the detailing. He was so childish he literally handed me the keys and stormed out of the show room. I feel management condones this type of behavior and didn\u2019t apologize for his associates actions. I am thankful for my initial experience and the manual.", "source": ""}, {"name": "Jesse", "date": "Aug 30, 2020", "avatar": "https://static1.cargurus.com/gfx/cg/user-noPic_vector.svg", "rating": "5", "title": "", "description": "Very helpful", "source": ""}, {"name": "Guru7V4BW", "date": "Jun 9, 2020", "avatar": "https://static1.cargurus.com/gfx/cg/user-noPic_vector.svg", "rating": "5", "title": "", "description": "Great experience.

Great place, sales person Luis was very friendly and helpful! Car was clean and took it for test drive. The only thing i could say on the downside of my experience there while buying my 2013 Ford Fusion was how slow it was in the financial aspect but it was a busy day also. I would recommend them for buying a car!!  I liked how they didn't pressure me into buying the car i didn't feel like i was obligated or forced into it , a big plus in my opinion. Anyhow its a great place! Good service and I'm glad i drove the 3+ hrs there to look at and end up buying the car only had it one day now but love it!!", "source": ""}, {"name": "David", "date": "Oct 20, 2019", "avatar": "https://static1.cargurus.com/gfx/cg/user-noPic_vector.svg", "rating": "5", "title": "", "description": "Drove there for 2.5 hrs from Columbus and our drive was totally worthy it. Went to go see the Genesis and to test drive it and ended driving back in the Genesis.\r\nThe experience was top notch especially the sales guy Dan. He made us feel welcome and explained all the features of the car before test driving it. The Finance guy too never pressured us to buy stuff like gap and extended warranty. Go visit Taylor Kia and make sure you ask for Dan.
